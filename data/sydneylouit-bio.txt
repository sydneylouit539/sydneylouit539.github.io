I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Statistics department at UConn. 

Before coming to UConn, I graduated from Cornell University in 2020 with a B.S.
in Biometry & Statistics. I have also completed several internships and
fellowships in the summers, with PerkinElmer (2017, 2018), DDHQ (2021, 2022),
and Travelers (2023, 2024).
